= Introduction = 

As the mscgen tool can be used to generate a graphical illustration of the use-cases, the mscgen file convention must not be changed. Therefore, all OpenMSC specific information needed to be added to the mscgen file must follow the mscgen file convention.

= Structure =

== Network Elements ==

Network elements are the communication entities in the MSC. Each network element *must* use a unique name.

== Use-Cases ==

OpenMSC expects exactly one _Success_ use-case and allows the user to specify _n_ failure use-cases. A use-case leverages the block of signals command `--- [ label = "Success" ]` where the label *must* be specified with the word _Success_.

== Communication Descriptor ==
A communication descriptor defines a single message flow from a source to a destination network element identified by a protocol, a primitive and a list of information elements and their values.

In other words, each line for a use-case in the openmsc.msc file is an individual communication descriptor.
