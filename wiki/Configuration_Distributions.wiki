#summary Explanation of distributions and the parameters which can be set in openmsc.cfg

= Introduction =

OpenMSC provides several distributions from which the user can select:
 * Gaussian
 * Exponential
 * Linear
 * Gamma
 * Erlang
 * Uniform (real)
 * Uniform (integer)

The distributions are used to determine the UE starting times as well as for the latencies between each communication descriptor. All distributions are implemented using the Boost::Math library.

= Distributions =
== Gaussian (Normal) ==
To use the gaussian distribution the user is asked to set the distribution's mean and standard deviation.

More information about how the gaussian distribution is implemented in Boost [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/dist_ref/dists/normal_dist.html follow this link].
== Gamma / Erlang ==
OpenMSC requests two parameters to set for both distributions, i.e., alpha (scale) and beta (shape). The only difference between gamma and erlang is that erlang only accepts integers for alpha and beta.
